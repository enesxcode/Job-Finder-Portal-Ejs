Project Overview:

Welcome to the project where we transform a static HTML template into a dynamic web application using EJS (Embedded JavaScript). EJS allows us to inject JavaScript code directly into our HTML templates, making it easier to manage and render dynamic content on the client side.

Getting Started:

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/ernest-frimpong-ai/Job-Finder-Portal-Ejs.git



Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd your-project



Install Dependencies:

npm install ejs
npm install express



Run the Application:

npm start

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

EJS Conversion Process
The HTML template has been refactored into EJS to enhance the project's flexibility and interactivity:

EJS Syntax:

    Integrate EJS syntax for dynamic content.
    
    Example: Convert <h1>Hello, World!</h1> to <h1><%= pageTitle %></h1>.


Partial Views:

    Break down the template into partial views for modularization.
    Include partial views using <%- include('partials/header') %>.


Dynamic Data:

    Leverage JavaScript logic within EJS to render dynamic data.
    Example: <% if (user) { %> Welcome, <%= user.name %>! <% } %>.
